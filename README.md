# Isentropic Gas Dynamics Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the one-dimensional system of isentropic gas dynamics, which models the behavior of an isentropic gas under variations in density, velocity, and pressure. The modeling relies on a set of partial differential equations that describe mass conservation and momentum conservation, with applications in various fields of physics and engineering, such as shock waves and expansion waves in gas dynamics.

## Objectives
- Develop theoretical foundations to understand analytical solutions.
- Implement numerical methods, including Lax-Friedrichs, Rusanov, and HLL schemes, to obtain approximate solutions.
- Compare analytical and numerical results to evaluate the accuracy of the approximations.

## Key Features
- Theoretical background for isentropic gas dynamics.
- Numerical implementation of various solution schemes.
- Comparative analysis of analytical and numerical results.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
